# algoVisualizer
 AlgoVisualizer AlgoVisualizer is an interactive algorithm visualizer that helps users understand key data structures and algorithms. The project features dynamic visualizations for various sorting algorithms and graph traversal methods, as well as data structures like singly linked lists.  Features: Bubble Sort: Watch how the array elements are sorted step by step using this simple comparison-based algorithm. Quick Sort: Explore how this divide-and-conquer algorithm partitions arrays and sorts them efficiently. Singly Linked List: Visualize insertion, deletion, and traversal operations in a singly linked list. Depth-First Search (DFS): Learn how DFS explores graphs by going deep into one branch at a time. Dijkstra's Algorithm: See how Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths in a weighted graph. This tool is designed to aid in learning, teaching, and debugging algorithms through clear and intuitive visual representations.
